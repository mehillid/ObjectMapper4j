------------------------------------------------------------
Library that serializes objects of unknown classes into
Maps and vice versa.
To do the reverse step (Mapped->Classes) you must have used
this utility previously to generate the mapped object.

A given class I define as:
- a class that is used to pass information, often has no
methods.
- Fields must not be final.
- Must have an empty constructor.

This library automatically converts an object into a mapped
one without using any added classes.
The field types supported in classes are:
- List
- Map
- other data classes
- Literals(Number, String, Boolean and primitives)
- Enums

This utility parses the data classes in LinkedHashMap.
Enums are set as strings using the ObjectMapper4j.EnumWrapper
class.
I recommend you look at the UnitTests class for this.

To import use jitpack or the only class available
